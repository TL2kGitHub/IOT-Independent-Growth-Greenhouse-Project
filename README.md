# IOT-Independent-Growth-Greenhouse-Project
This repo contains my second year IOT project.
The project uses a range of electronic components and sensors to allow the user to maintain and irrigate a greenhouse without requiring the user to manually check on the greenhouse. 
It uses a webserver to allow the user to check the temperature, humidity and soil moisture in the greenhouse and automatically waters the plants when the soil moisture goes below 30%. 
A fan turns on if the humidity exceeds 70%. A blue RGB strips activates if the day is dull and the greenhouse is not getting enough sunlight.
